The idea behind LIBS stems from the fact that every element emits light of distinguishable wavelength. This property makes it possible to match emitted wavelengths of an unknown element to a data bank of elemental wavelengths. Thus, the emitted wavelengths can be observed as “signatures” of their elements. The LIBS process starts with the laser pulse dumping high concentration of energy over a narrow area of the target material. This creates a plasma plume of extremely high temperature that atomizes the target material. Only a few picograms to one nanogram of the target material is destroyed in the process – an infinitesimal amount of destruction compared to almost any other technique. When the plasma begins to cool, the ions lose energy by spontaneously emitting light of wavelengths characteristic of the parent element. This whole process occurs within a few microseconds.
